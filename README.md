# ev-charging-reliability-prediction
Built a PySpark ML pipeline in Google Colab to predict EV charging station failures using 6M records across 97K+ stations. Improved recall to 72.5% (6.6x gain) by addressing 187:1 class imbalance via undersampling. Automated NREL API ingestion and applied PCA (80→8 features, 96% variance), identifying key reliability drivers.
